# csapp

The csapp project is my learning record of the CSAPP.

The source code in `code` directory is my learning record of video course of [yaaangmin](https://space.bilibili.com/4564101?spm_id_from=333.337.0.0), you can also learn all his code from his project [bcst_csapp](https://github.com/yangminz/bcst_csapp).

The source code in `lab` directory is the lab code of CSAPP, but it's empty for now.
