## code
The code in `code` is my learning record of video course of [yaaangmin](https://space.bilibili.com/4564101). His public repo [bcst_csapp](https://github.com/yangminz/bcst_csapp) is also available.

### simple-asm-simulator
The `simple-asm-simulator` project is the bcst_csapp code before [video 0x08](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1WK41137JT) (the first code rebuilding).

This project simulates 15 assembly instructions of `add.c`. The 15 instructions is shown in `add.txt`, and is simply placed in `code.c`.

The check information of registers and memory in `main.c` is obtained through gdb.

### csapp
The `csapp` project is the bcst_csapp code after [video 0x08](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1WK41137JT) (the first code rebuilding).
